# GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin • [![test](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Build documentation websites using Markdown and GOV.UK styles.

You’re welcome to use the plugin even if your service isn’t considered part of GOV.UK, but your site or service must not:

- identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
- suggest that it’s an official UK government website if it’s not

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20 or later
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) v2 or later

## Installation

`npm install @x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin`

## Usage

## Releasing a new version

`npm run release`

This command will ask you what version you want to use. It will then publish a new version on NPM, create and push a new git tag and then generate release notes ready for posting on GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> Releasing a new version requires permission to publish packages to the `@x-govuk` organisation.
