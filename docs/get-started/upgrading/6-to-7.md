## Requirements

The minimum requirements for this version have changed:

- [Node.js v22](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v22-release-announce)
- [Eleventy v3](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

## ES modules

The plugin is now provided as an ES module with a named export, instead of using the older CommonJS format (which uses `require()` to import modules).

If you are already using ES modules in your project, update the following import:

```diff
- import govukEleventyPlugin from '@x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin'
+ import { govukEleventyPlugin } from '@x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin'
```

If your project is using CommonJS, you will need to import the plugin using a dynamic `import()`. Refer to [CommonJS vs. ESM](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/cjs-esm/) on the Eleventy website for more information.

## Virtual templates

The plugin now provides its layouts using Eleventy’s [virtual templates](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/virtual-templates/) feature.

This means that [default layouts can be overridden](/layouts/#overriding-layouts) in your project by creating layouts with the same name.

Remove the path to the layouts folder in `node_modules` from `dir.layouts` in your configuration file:

```diff
  dir: {
    input: 'docs',
-   layouts: '../node_modules/@x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin/layouts'
  }
```

## GOV.UK rebrand

Sites can use GOV.UK’s refreshed brand from 25 June 2025 by setting a new `rebrand` option.

The default value for this option is `false`. A minor release after 25 June 2025 will change this default to `true`.

> The v7.1 release changed this default to `true`. A later release will remove this option.

## Service navigation

The plugin now accepts all options for [service navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/), if shown.

The name of this option has changed from `navigation` to `serviceNavigation`, with `navigation.items` renamed `serviceNavigation.navigation`:

```diff
  import { govukEleventyPlugin } from '@x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin'

  export default function(eleventyConfig) {
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(govukEleventyPlugin, {
-     navigation: {
-       items: [{
+     serviceNavigation: {
+       navigation: {
          text: 'API reference',
          href: '/api'
        }, {
          text: 'Glossary',
          href: '/glossary'
        }]
      }
    })

    // Other configuration options
    ...
  }
```

It is also possible to show a search field in the service navigation, using the new `serviceNavigation.search` option.

## RSS feeds

The RSS feed layout now correctly supports limiting the number of items, in reverse chronological order:

```diff
  ---
  eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true
  layout: feed
  permalink: /posts/feed.xml
- pagination:
+ collection
-   data: collections.post
+   name: post
-   size: 20
+   limit: 20
-   reverse: true
  ---
```

Featured post images are now included in the generated feed.

## Configuration options removed

- The deprecated `header.organisationName` option has been removed. Use `titleSuffix` to change the value shown at the end of document titles (the default is `'GOV.UK'`).

- The `scssSettingsFile` option has been removed. You can now [customise GOV.UK Frontend settings](/get-started/design/#replace-the-gds-transport-typeface) by providing your own stylesheet and setting values for `"pkg:govuk-frontend/dist/govuk"` with `@use`:

```scss
// Use GOV.UK Frontend
$_font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
@use "pkg:govuk-frontend/dist/govuk" with (
  $govuk-font-family: $_font-family,
  $govuk-brand-colour: #8822aa,
  $govuk-link-colour: #660088,
  $govuk-link-hover-colour: #440066,
  $govuk-link-visited-colour: #333366,
  $govuk-page-width: 1100px
);

// Use GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin components
@use "pkg:@x-govuk/govuk-eleventy-plugin";
```
