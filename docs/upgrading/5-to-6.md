## Customise GOV.UK Frontend settings

It’s now possible to customise all [GOV.UK Frontend settings](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#settings) to adjust the appearance of your site.

Add values to a SCSS file and save it as `/sass/_settings.scss`, within your site’s [input directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#input-directory). You can choose an alternative location for this settings file with the `scssSettingsPath` option.

For example, to change your site’s brand colour and typeface, set values for the following SCSS variables:

```scss
$govuk-brand-colour: #2288aa;
$govuk-font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
```

With this more flexible method of customising styles available, the following options have been removed:

- `brandColour` (`$govuk-brand-colour`)
- `fontFamily` (`$govuk-font-family`)
- `assetsPath` (`$govuk-assets-path`)
- `fontsPath` (`$govuk-fonts-path`)
- `imagesPath` (`$govuk-images-path`)

## Customising the header

With the introduction of [`govuk-frontend` version 5.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.0.0), the logo in the header is now provided as a single SVG image. To support this change, the following options have been added:

- `header.logotype.text` - Text to show instead of the GOV.UK logo. This text will appear bold and replace the crown icon and ‘GOV.UK’ text.
- `header.logotype.html` - HTML to use instead of the GOV.UK logo. Use this option to supply your own SVG image. If `header.logotype.text` is set, this is not required. If `header.logotype.html` is provided, the `header.logotype.text` option will be ignored.

With this change, the following options have been removed:

- `header.organisationLogo`
- `header.organisationName`

## `url` filter no longer required

The plugin enables [Eleventy’s HTML base plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/html-base/) which will rewrite URLs to include a configured `pathPrefix`.

This means you no longer need to use the `url` filter. Remove this filter from any custom templates and check that any paths point to their correct location.
