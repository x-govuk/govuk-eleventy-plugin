## Side navigation layout

The `side-navigation` layout was renamed `sub-navigation`, so use this name wherever you call this layout. For example, in a document’s front matter:

```diff
- layout: side-navigation
+ layout: sub-navigation
  title: My post
```

## Open Graph images

Plugin and front matter option names were updated to match names [introduced in `govuk-frontend` v4.3.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.0).

### Setting a default Open Graph image

Within plugin options, `ogImage` was renamed to `opengraphImageUrl`. A complete URL is also required for this value.

Example:

```diff
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(govukEleventyPlugin, {
-   ogImage: '/assets/opengraph-image.png',
+   opengraphImageUrl: 'https://example.org/assets/opengraph-image.png',
  })
```

### Using a post image as Open Graph image

Within front matter options, `image.ogImage` was renamed `image.opengraphImage`. For example:

```diff
  image:
    src: "/assets/post-image.png"
    alt: "Post image"
-   ogImage: true
+   opengraphImage: true
```

### Adding an Open Graph image to a document

Within front matter options, `ogImage` was renamed `opengraphImage`. For example:

```diff
- ogImage:
+ opengraphImage:
    src: "/assets/another-opengraph-image.png"
    alt: "Another Open Graph image"
```

## Footer options

Plugin options were updated to better align with the changes to the footer component [introduced in `govuk-frontend` v4.3.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.0).

### Setting a custom content licence

You can change the content licence in the footer using the `footer.contentLicence` option. This replaces `footer.licence`.

`footer.contentLicence` takes either a `text` or `html` value, and no longer parses Markdown. Unlike the component in the Design System, using this option will prevent the OGL logo from appearing to the left of the content licence.

Example:

```diff
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(govukEleventyPlugin, {
    footer: {
-     licence: 'Licensed under the MIT Licence'
+     contentLicence: {
+       text: 'Licensed under the MIT Licence'
+     }
    }
  })
```

### Setting a custom copyright statement

`footer.copyright` takes either a `text` or `html` value, and no longer parses Markdown. Unlike the component in the Design System, using this option prevents the Royal Coat of Arms from appearing above the copyright statement.

Example:

```diff
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(govukEleventyPlugin, {
    footer: {
-     copyright: '© 2022 My Organistion'
+     copyright: {
+       text: '© 2022 My Organistion'
+     }
    }
  })
```

## Article component

If you were [overriding a layout](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/layouts/#overriding-layouts) and using the `appArticle` component, this was removed and replaced with separate `appDocumentHeader` and `appDocumentFooter` components.
