A sitemap is a page that lists all the pages on your site. It helps users find content when they cannot locate what theyâ€™re looking for through your main navigation.

The GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin creates a sitemap page that automatically lists all your site's pages in a clear, organised way.

## Configure the sitemap page

The plugin enables the sitemap page by default (it is linked to from the 404 page). To turn it off, set `templates.sitemap` to `false` in your plugin options.

Or, you can customise the page by using these options:

| Name      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title     | string | Sets the page title. Default is `Sitemap`)                                                                                 |
| permalink | string | Sets the file name and location. Default is `/sitemap/`. Set to `false` to disable writing this file to the output folder. |

## Change how the sitemap page looks

The sitemap page uses the [sitemap layout](/layouts/sitemap). You can override this layout to change how the page appears.
