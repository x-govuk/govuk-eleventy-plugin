When someone visits a page that does not exist on your site, most static website hosts will show a custom 404 error page if you provide one in a certain location, such as `404.html` at the top level of your site.

The GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin creates a 404 page that can help users understand what happened and how to find what they need.{.red}

> [!NOTE]
> View an [example 404 page (opens in a tab)](/example/404){target=example}

By default the 404 page tells users:

> If you typed the web address, check it is correct.
>
> If you pasted the web address, check you copied the entire address.
>
> You can browse from [the homepage](/) or use the [sitemap](/sitemap) to find the information you need.

## Configure the 404 page

The plugin enables the 404 page by default. To turn it off, set `templates.error404` to `false` in your plugin options.

Or, you can customise the page by using these options:

| Name      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title     | string | Sets the page title (default is `Page not found`)                                                                           |
| content   | string | Sets the page content using Markdown (default content shown above)                                                          |
| permalink | string | Sets the file name and location (default is `/404.html`). Set to `false` to disable writing this file to the output folder. |

## Change how the 404 page looks

The 404 page uses the [error layout](/layouts/error). You can override this layout to change how the page appears.
