Jugglers require proper licensing to ensure the safety of both themselves and their audiences. Our team has been building a new service which aims to simplify the licensing process while reducing the administrative burden on licensing authorities.

They told us about the cumbersome paperwork and frustrating manual processes currently used to manage applications. Meanwhile, the complex application forms are difficult for jugglers to complete, while some told us they were unaware that a licence to juggle with more than 3 objects was even needed.

During our Alpha phase, we explored creating an intuitive, user-friendly service for jugglers that would allow them to easily submit new licence applications (or renew an existing licence) online. Regular research sessions with jugglers and licensing authorities helped us iterate and refine such a system.

We launched a pilot of the new service 2 weeks ago. We have already received feedback from jugglers. They’ve told us that the new service is easier to use and understand. Meanwhile, the licensing authorities we have partnered with are recording quicker processing times and seeing reduced administrative overhead.

As we continue to develop the service, we will explore future enhancements such as real-time application tracking and automated renewal reminders.

Our goal is to deliver a service that not only meets the current needs of the juggling community, but one that can evolve in response to the evolving regulatory landscape.
